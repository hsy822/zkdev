## 🧪 Remix IDE

[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) is a powerful, web-based development environment for building and deploying Ethereum smart contracts. It offers a no-setup, beginner-friendly interface while also supporting advanced workflows through plugins, a visual debugger, and integration with external tools. 
Whether you're just getting started or already an experienced developer, Remix is the place many turn to for rapid prototyping and experimentation on Ethereum.

## 🔒 Aztec Remix Plugin

The **Aztec Remix Plugin** brings Aztec’s privacy-first smart contract framework directly into the Remix IDE.  
It allows you to:

- Compile Noir smart contracts using `aztec-nargo`
- Deploy contracts to the Aztec Network
- Simulate and send transactions
- Interact with deployed contracts, including externally deployed ones

This plugin is designed to make developing private applications on Aztec fast, accessible, and interactive — all within the familiar Remix interface.
